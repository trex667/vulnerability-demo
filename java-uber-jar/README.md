# test owasp dependecy check with a shded jar

# Example
1. prepare the pom and add a dependency to a uber jar file. A uber jar includes all of his dependencies in a single file, e.g. the uber jar of CVE-2022-42889 including common-text with a vulnerability.
2. mvn clean verify

__Result__
The plugin detects the included vulnerability because the pom files are also included in the uber jar. When excluding the pom files no vulnerability is found. See filter of shade plugin to exclude: [pom.xml](../cve/CVE-2022-42889/pom.xml) 

:exclamation:
The evidence count is lower as it is when you have the artifact directly in the pom, like it is in [pom.xml](../cve/CVE-2022-42889/pom.xml)
:exclamation:

* evidence count with direct dependency: 68
* evidence count with uber jar including pom files: 42
